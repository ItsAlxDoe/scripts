Scripts Dump

Repository for all my scripts and the like

System
---
For whatever I wanna automate in my Linux system or elsewhere that isn't Windows

Shell
---
For my shell scripts, may work on Windows via WSL. POSIX compliance possibly guaranteed

Winblows
---
Windows-native scripts, mainly app manifests for [their *still officially CLI-only* package manager, WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget)
